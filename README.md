**SquadSync** is a collaborative web platform designed to help friend groups, clubs, and teams stay organized.
It brings together everyday essentials like expense sharing, task tracking, reminders, group polls, photo memories, and a notification system — all inside a clean and simple interface.

This project was created by me and my friend during a technical event called DevQuest, where we were given 3 hours to build a working solution based on a problem statement.
To save time during rapid development, we used AI tools to generate parts of the UI, but the overall system architecture, backend logic, feature planning, and integration were implemented by us.
